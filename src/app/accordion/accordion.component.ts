MorPhiC is a collaborative research project that aims to functionally characterize all protein-coding human genes. The project focuses on developing a catalog of molecular and cellular phenotypes for null alleles for every protein-coding human gene. The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the biological function of each human gene, filling the knowledge gap for the majority of genes that are currently underrepresented in scientific literature.')

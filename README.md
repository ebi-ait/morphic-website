## Branch strategy
| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **main** | Source of truth. Has a manual trigger when triggered, builds and deploys the `main` branch. |
| **dev** | Development beanch and environment that points to [dev.morphic.bio](https://dev.morphic.bio). Every push triggers a CI job that builds and deploys the latest Docker image to the live EKS cluster. |

> **Note:** Feature work is done in shortâ€‘lived branches and merged into `dev` through pull requests.
Once tested and when stakeholders are happy, changes are cherry-picked onto `main` and deployed.

The website is accessible at [morphic.bio](https://morphic.bio).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (>=18.13.x) and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Gatsby CLI**: Install globally using `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
- **AWS CLI**: For interacting with AWS services from the command line
- **AWS Account**: With S3 and CloudFront configured
- **Git**: For version control

### AWS Configuration

Ensure that you have the following AWS resources set up:

- An S3 bucket configured to host a static website.
- A CloudFront distribution configured with the S3 bucket as the origin.
- An IAM user with sufficient permissions to upload files to S3 and manage CloudFront.

## Local development
```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/ebi-ait/morphic-website.git
cd morphic-website

# 2. Install dependencies
cd react-app
npm install    # or yarn install

# 3. Run the dev server
npm start      # http://localhost:3000
```

## Docker & Kubernetes deployment

1. **Image build**
   The root `Dockerfile` builds the production bundle from `react-app/`.

2. **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**
   - On every push to `dev` the workflow:
     1. Builds and tags a Docker image.
     2. Pushes the image to the container registry.
     3. Applies manifests under `k8s/` to the EKS cluster (via `kubectl apply`).

3. **Kubernetes manifests**
   - `k8s/deployment.yaml` â€“ Deployment & rolling updates.
   - `k8s/service.yaml` â€“ ClusterIP / LoadBalancer.
   - `k8s/ingress.yaml` â€“ External URL and TLS (if configured).

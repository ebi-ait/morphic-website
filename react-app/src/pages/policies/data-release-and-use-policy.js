      <h1>MorPhiC Consortium - Data Release and Use Policy</h1>
      <p>Version 1.1 - December 1, 2023</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          The MorPhiC Consortium Data Release and Use Policy will be reviewed
          and, if necessary, updated on a semi-annual basis.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          Rationale: To catalyze research within and outside the MorPhiC
          Consortium and to provide a rich community resource.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This document describes the MorPhiC Consortium policy for releasing
        data, both internally and to the public. All data generated as part of a
        MorPhiC Consortium-funded project are subject to this policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy encourages the open sharing of data generated by the MorPhiC
        Consortium program with the use of a specific permissible license (CC BY
        4.0 license). All data needs to be shared with the MorPhiC Consortium
        Data Resource and Analysis Coordinating Center (DRACC). All data (raw
        and processed) will be disseminated centrally through the MorPhiC DRACC.
        Dissemination through DRACC includes open access data as well as the
        distribution to external data resources for controlled access data (CAD)
        (e.g., databases like dbGaP). The controlled access data is defined by
        the consent permissions and data usage and modification restrictions.
        The data derived from CAD is considered open access.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Development Levels</h2>
      <p>
        Many groups in the MorPhiC Consortium are engaged in developing new
        technologies for investigating the functional roles of human genes in a
        multicellular system by generating functional null alleles. For data
        release, the policy differentiates between data generated with more
        established assays with agreed-upon standards and processing workflows,
        and data generated with emerging technologies, which require more
        internal vetting prior to public release.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Production Data</b> is defined as an established data type which has
        an approved metadata model, a common protocol that has been approved by
        the MorPhiC Steering Committee, and a data processing workflow approved
        by the MorPhiC Data Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology Development Data is defined as an emerging data type for
        which a working protocol is available in PDF format, but no approved
        metadata model exists. As novel technologies and analytical workflows
        developed in the MorPhiC become more refined and standardized, these
        data types may be reclassified as production data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a protocol has officially been approved for a technology
        development data type, a metadata model has been implemented, and a
        standard processing pipeline established, the data will become a
        production data type. Any previously submitted data for such data types
        will be made publicly available using the quality flags provided by the
        submitter.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Release Stages</h2>
      <p>
        Data is expected to be released in three stages: (1) archival data
        release consisting of data contributed by the Data Production Centers
        (DPCs), with base level of QC checking; (2) secondary-processed data
        generated by the standardized processing pipelines, where the data
        processing pipelines and data levels will be designed jointly by the
        DRACC and the DWG (Data Working Group); and (3) integrated data release
        including analysis results such that the full uniformly processed
        MorPhiC dataset is queryable by e.g., gene (MorPhiC Data Portal).{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Internal release will consist of archival and secondary-processed data.
        Public release will consist of archival, secondary-processed, and
        integrated data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data may be updated in subsequent data releases, according to
        guidance and feedback from the DWG. Release of some data may be
        restricted as a result of QC measures, consent restrictions, and other
        relevant considerations.{" "}
      </p>
      <h2>Data Release Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        All MorPhiC generated data needs to be shared with the DRACC
        immediately, or as soon as possible, after it has been generated and the
        QC performed.
      </p>
      <h3>Production Data</h3>
      <p>
        Production data and associated metadata will be shared internally on a
        monthly basis following completion of the submission to the DRACC, as
        the archival and secondary-process data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Production data and associated metadata will be shared with the public
        on a 6-months cycle basis, as the archival, secondary-processed, and
        integrated data. Before the public release, the data needs to be
        signed-off by the data producer.
      </p>
      <h3>Technology Development Data</h3>
      <p>
        Technology development data will be shared internally on a monthly basis
        following completion of the submission to the DRACC, as archival
        release.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule, any MorPhiC Consortium data used in a manuscript
        submitted to a preprint server must be publicly available at that time.
      </p>
      <h2>Considerations for Use of MorPhiC Consortium Data</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Use of public data by external users:</b> External data users may
        download, analyze, and publish results based on the public open access
        MorPhiC Consortium data, under the terms of CC BY 4.0 license.
        Controlled access data is subject to consent permissions and data usage
        and modification restrictions.
        <br></br>Researchers using public, but yet to be published MorPhiC
        Consortium data must contact the specific data producer to discuss
        possible coordinated publication. Unpublished data are those that have
        never been described and referenced by a peer-reviewed publication. Use
        of MorPhiC Consortium data must be cited as described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of internally shared data by MorPhiC Consortium members: MorPhiC
        Consortium members have access to production and technology development
        data prior to public release. Use of these data in a publication prior
        to public release must be accomplished as a collaboration with the data
        producer. Compliance with this policy will be monitored and failure to
        abide by this policy will be reported to the MorPhiC Consortium Steering
        Committee and Program Directors.
        <br></br>Internal use and sharinging of the identifiable data is defined
        by the MorPhiC Data Use Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Citation of MorPhiC Consortium data:</b> Any data and data products
        released by the MorPhiC Consortium must be referenced using the official
        accession numbers and any relevant Data Release numbers (so that
        downstream analyses are reproducible), provided by DRACC. Manuscripts
        using data released by the Consortium must also{" "}
        <b>
          cite (1) the latest Consortium publication (doi: MorPhiC white paper,
          to be added when published)
        </b>{" "}
        and{" "}
        <b>
          (2) all relevant publications and preprints describing MorPhiC
          Consortium data referenced in the manuscript.
        </b>{" "}
        The corresponding MorPhiC Consortium Data Production Centers or labs
        must be acknowledged.

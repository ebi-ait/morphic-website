      <h1>MorPhiC Publication Policy</h1>
      <p>Version 0.9, Jun 01, 2023</p>
      <p>
        Primary Author Stephan Schürer; based on the GREGoR Consortium
        Publications Policy and the 4DN Publication Policy
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The publication policy established by the MorPhiC Consortium is meant to
        (1) create transparency and foster collaboration within the Consortium,
        (2) encourage and facilitate timely circulation of MorPhiC Consortium
        work products, (3) ensure appropriate use of Consortium data, tool, and
        other resources, (4) support adherence to authorship principles, (5)
        comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, and (6) maintain a complete,
        up-to-date list of MorPhiC publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy encourages the open sharing of information within the
        network. In keeping with this principle, sharing of manuscript drafts
        and solicitation of feedback by network members before submission is
        strongly encouraged.
      </p>

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This policy applies to any scientific work carried out by MorPhiC
        members (core, affiliate, and partner) where MorPhiC funding is used for
        data generation, development of tools, infrastructure, or data analysis.
        The policy applies to full papers including conference papers and
        communications; conference abstracts are mentioned below. Consortium
        commentaries, perspectives, and “best practices” manuscripts are also
        within scope.
      </p>
      <p>This policy does not apply to the following activities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Publications from non-MorPhiC members</li>
        <li>
          Publications led by non-MorPhiC members for which one or more MorPhiC
          investigators provide consultation and input that does not use data or
          resources from MorPhiC
        </li>
        <li>
          Publications from MorPhiC members that result from prior work or work
          not primarily or partially related to the MorPhiC program and that do
          not use MorPhiC resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note while not in scope of the policy, guidance on acknowledgements
          language is provided below
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Should there be uncertainty about whether the policy applies,
        investigators are encouraged to contact the MorPhiC DRACC or, if needed,
        the MorPhiC Steering Committee.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy</h2>

      <h3>Notification and Comment Process</h3>
      <p>Notification</p>
      <p>
        Notification of MorPhiC publications is important for creating
        transparency and maximizing opportunities for collaboration within the
        Consortium. Notification occurs when a lead author or designee creates a
        record for publication in progress in the internal tracking Google
        sheet, including basic information such as topic/title, dataset(s) used,
        and Research Center(s) involved. The document is visible by Consortium
        members. Authors can also leverage the OWG to communicate and coordinate
        publications. Notification should occur before a preprint is submitted.
      </p>
      <p>Comment</p>
      <p>
        All MorPhiC Consortium members (core and partner members) are welcome to
        comment on submitted publication notification forms. Comments are to be
        submitted in the two-week window following submission to the website.
      </p>
      <p>Status Updates</p>
      <p>
        Submitting authors will be asked to report to the DRACC any major
        updates on their submitted publication notification forms. Major updates
        include pre-print available (provide DOI), published (provide PubMed
        ID), changes to key contacts, or archived/no longer moving forward.
        Authors may also proactively provide such updates to the DRACC at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>Confidentiality</p>
      <p>
        Manuscript details collected in the notification and comment process
        must be treated as confidential, and may not be shared outside of the
        network prior to availability of a pre-print.
      </p>

      <h3>Roles</h3>
      <p>Roles in the MorPhiC publication processes are as follows:</p>
      <p>Data Resource & Administrative Coordination Center (DRACC)</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Research Center PIs</p>• Determine who from their Center should be
      listed on the Consortium banner and update banner author members on the
      Google Sheet.
      <p>Steering Committee (SC)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjudicates publication-related conflicts</li>
        <li>
          Publication-related concerns or potential conflicts can be raised to
          the SC co-chairs and/or the DRACC, who will triage as needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consortium members</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MorPhiC Consortium members (core and partner) are invited (but not
          required) to submit comments on publication notification records in
          the two-week window following submission to the MorPhiC website
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Authorship</h3>
      <p>
        Facilitating cross-Consortium collaboration is a key element of the
        MorPhiC Consortium and this publication policy. Authorship should be
        discussed early in the process (e.g. at manuscript concept stage) to
        enable substantive contribution and fairness in representation.
        Principles of authorship in MorPhiC include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inclusivity</li>
        <li>
          Providing opportunities for trainees and early stage investigators
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognition for efforts of the DRACC (co-author or acknowledgement as
          appropriate) 
        </li>
        <li>Adherence to standard authorship criteria (see ICMJE standards)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Banner authorship</p>
      <p>
        For manuscripts utilizing cross-MorPhiC Consortium data and/or other
        cross-Consortium contributions (publication types D-F), banner
        authorship is required to acknowledge the efforts of the Consortium. A
        list of the members of the banner are maintained by the DCC on the
        Consortium website. Center PIs decide who from their group is on the
        Consortium banner and communicate that (along with any updates or
        changes) to the DCC. We encourage inclusion of members who are
        contributing to MorPhiC.
      </p>
      <p>
        For manuscripts deriving from MorPhiC Working Groups, it is at the
        discretion of the WG to determine if a banner authorship for the WG is
        appropriate. If appropriate, please refer to the MorPhiC website for the
        current list of WG members.
      </p>

      <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
      <p>
        All relevant papers should include a statement citing the NIH grant
        support for the work, listing the appropriate grant number(s) and
        acknowledging the MorPhiC Consortium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research reported in this publication was supported by the National
        Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health
        under Award Number ##awardnumber##. The content is solely the
        responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the
        official views of the National Institutes of Health.
      </p>

      <h3>Submitting Abstracts to Scientific Meetings</h3>
      <p>
        Abstracts do not require notification to the MorPhiC Consortium before
        submission to a conference; however, co-authors on the abstract should
        be notified with at least 48 hours notice. While not required,
        submission of an abstract to the MorPhiC website prior to the conference
        is encouraged. A list of all abstracts submitted to the DRACC will be
        maintained on the website by the DRACC. The same authorship
        considerations apply to abstracts as to manuscripts.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        All authors should ensure that their analysis is consistent with the
        conditions of the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy and the MorPhiC Data
        Sharing policy.
      </p>

      <h3>NIH Public Access Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Please note, all manuscripts developed by or in association with the
        MorPhiC Consortium must be deposited in PubMed Central. This step is
        critical for ongoing NIH funding, and authors should be aware of this
        requirement prior to submitting any article to a journal. For more
        information on this process, please visit the NIH Public Access Policy.
      </p>
	  
      <h3>Preprint Policy and Guidance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The MorPhiC Consortium strongly encourages submission of all
            publications to a preprint server in advance of submission for
            publication to ensure timely access to scientific work.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Preprints of submitted manuscripts must be shared with the public via
          an appropriate public preprint server (such as bioRxiv, medRxiv,
          arXiv, ChemRxiv) prior to, or concurrently with the time of submission
          to a journal, unless an exception or extension was granted by the
          Morphic Consortium Steering Committee.
        </li>
        <li>
          Co-submissions to public preprint servers should be coordinated among
          network members when appropriate. The manuscript tracking Google sheet
          should be updated with a link to the preprint, once it becomes
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exceptions or extensions may be requested in cases where sharing of
          preprints is not allowed due to legal requirements related to the
          protection of intellectual property, or when the target journal does
          not allow preprints to be shared prior to publication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Requests for exception or extension should be made via email to the
          NIH voting member (Dr. Judy Mietz mietzj@mail.nih.gov) with a CC to
          Dr. Lisa Chadwick (chadwickL@niehs.nih.gov). Requests should explain
          why an exception or extension from the preprint policy is required,
          and should be supported by sufficient documentation from the
          institutional technology transfer office of the PI, or from the
          targeted journal. Such requests should be made well in advance of
          submission to a journal, in order to allow time for consideration by
          the Steering Committee.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Citation of preprints</h3>
      <p>
        The MorPhiC Consortium acknowledges that public preprints are considered
        publications for all practical purposes by Consortium members, and
        should be cited and credited like papers. Preprints establish priority
        in the field, can be included in progress reports, CVs, and lists of
        publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open Access: Publications must at a minimum comply with the NIH Public
        Access policy (https://publicaccess.nih.gov/). In order to maximize the
        impact of the efforts of the network, authors should make strong efforts
        to publish their work using open access policies whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Related Work: We encourage network members to share information about
        planned or submitted manuscripts even if the work is not funded by the
        network but related to the mission of the Morphic Consortium project.
      </p>
